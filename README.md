# Rankin-Cohen Brackets with Ramanujan's Identities

This repository contains a Python implementation for calculating the **Rankin-Cohen brackets** of modular forms, specifically using **Ramanujan's identities** to handle the differentiation of Eisenstein series \( E_2, E_4, E_6 \).

## Overview

Modular forms are a central object in number theory and mathematical physics. The **Rankin-Cohen bracket** is an operation that produces new modular forms from existing ones. This code provides symbolic computation of Rankin-Cohen brackets using the symbolic algebra library **SymPy**.

The key features of the implementation are:
- **Symbolic Differentiation** using Ramanujan's identities for Eisenstein series.
- **Rankin-Cohen Bracket Calculation** for modular forms of specific weights.
- **Simplification of Results** using SymPy’s symbolic manipulation capabilities.

### Features:
1. **Differentiation of Eisenstein Series** \( E_2, E_4, E_6 \) using Ramanujan’s identities.
2. **Calculation of the k-th derivative** of modular forms.
3. **Computation of Rankin-Cohen brackets** for two modular forms of given weights and bracket order \( n \).

## Installation

You need to have **Python** installed along with the **SymPy** library. You can install SymPy via pip:

```bash
pip install sympy
